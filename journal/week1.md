# Week 1 â€” App Containerization


## Todo list
- [x] Watch weekly videos
- [x] Containerize Application (Dockerfiles, Docker Compose)
- [x] Write a Flask Backend Endpoint for Notifications
- [x] Write a React Page for Notifications
- [x] Run DynamoDB Local Container and ensure it works
- [x] Run Postgres Container and ensure it works

## Containerize Application (Dockerfiles, Docker Compose)
* This week we learned about Docker and how to create Docker file and Build a Docer container.
* Docker lets us containerizes our application so the application can be used across differnt hardware devices.

### Creaing Dockerfile
 <p>We created a Dockerfile in `backend-flask/Dockerfile` using the commands below, these commands are instructions on how to build our Docker Image. When we execute the Dockerfile, this file will build our image.</p>
 
 ```dockerfile
FROM python:3.10-slim-buster

WORKDIR /backend-flask

COPY requirements.txt requirements.txt
RUN pip3 install -r requirements.txt

COPY . .

ENV FLASK_ENV=development

EXPOSE ${PORT}
CMD [ "python3", "-m" , "flask", "run", "--host=0.0.0.0", "--port=4567"]
```
<p>The following will setup flask and allow us to access our backend on port 4567, we also have to set environmental variables `export FRONTEND_URL = "*"`
`export BACKEND_URL = "*"`, this allows us to access the frontend and backend. We can confirm if these have been set by running `env | grep BACKEND` or `env | grep BACKEND` </p>

```sh
cd backend-flask
export FRONTEND_URL="*"
export BACKEND_URL="*"
python3 -m flask run --host=0.0.0.0 --port=4567
cd ..
```
