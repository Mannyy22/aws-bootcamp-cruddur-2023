## Containerize Application (Dockerfiles, Docker Compose)
* This week we learned about Docker and how to create Docker file and Build a Docer container.
* Docker lets us containerizes our application so the application can be used across differnt hardware devices.

### Creaing Dockerfile
 <p>We created a Dockerfile in `backend-flask/Dockerfile` using the commands below. This is a list of commands that when we run this file will assemble our image.</p>
 
 ```dockerfile
FROM python:3.10-slim-buster

WORKDIR /backend-flask

COPY requirements.txt requirements.txt
RUN pip3 install -r requirements.txt

COPY . .

ENV FLASK_ENV=development

EXPOSE ${PORT}
CMD [ "python3", "-m" , "flask", "run", "--host=0.0.0.0", "--port=4567"]
```
