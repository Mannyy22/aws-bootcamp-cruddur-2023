## Instrument Honeycomb with OTEL
This week we learned about Distributed Tracing. Distributed Tracing is basically how we track/manage all the request that go through our Software Systems


Setup OTEL_SERVICE_NAME in my docker-compose file:

My Honeycomb account

When first setting up a Honeycomb, we had to add the following below to our `requirements.txt`

```
opentelemetry-api 
opentelemetry-sdk 
opentelemetry-exporter-otlp-proto-http 
opentelemetry-instrumentation-flask 
opentelemetry-instrumentation-requests
```
Then we installed it using these dependencies:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then added Add to the following below to our `app.py` This setup tracing so we could send Data to honey comb

```py
from opentelemetry import trace
from opentelemetry.instrumentation.flask import FlaskInstrumentor
from opentelemetry.instrumentation.requests import RequestsInstrumentor
from opentelemetry.exporter.otlp.proto.http.trace_exporter import OTLPSpanExporter
from opentelemetry.sdk.trace import TracerProvider
from opentelemetry.sdk.trace.export import BatchSpanProcessor
```


```py
# Initialize tracing and an exporter that can send data to Honeycomb
provider = TracerProvider()
processor = BatchSpanProcessor(OTLPSpanExporter())
provider.add_span_processor(processor)
trace.set_tracer_provider(provider)
tracer = trace.get_tracer(__name__)
```

 Grabbed the API key from your honeycomb account and assigned enviroment variable:

```sh
export HONEYCOMB_API_KEY=""
gp env HONEYCOMB_API_KEY=""
```

After the above steps Data was finally able to get to Honeycomb and we were able to query the data and visualize it
